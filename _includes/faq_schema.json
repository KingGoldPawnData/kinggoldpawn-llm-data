        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A pawn loan provides immediate cash by using your valuable item as collateral. You bring your item (jewelry, electronics, etc.) to the pawnshop along with a valid ID. The item is evaluated, and you receive a loan based on its value—typically 60-70% of resale value. In New York, you have a 4-month term under Article 5 regulations to repay the loan plus interest (typically ~4% monthly). When you repay, you get your item back. No credit check is required."

        "text": "If you can't repay your loan by the end of the 4-month term in New York, you have options: extend by paying the interest, surrender the item (no credit impact), or make partial payments if allowed. There's no negative impact on your credit score since pawn loans don't require credit checks and aren't reported to credit bureaus."
