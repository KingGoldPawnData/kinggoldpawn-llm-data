# King Gold & Pawn Item Guide – Musical Instruments

## Category Overview
- **Scope:** Guitars, basses, keyboards, digital pianos, violins, brass/woodwind instruments, percussion, DJ gear, and orchestral instruments accepted across all seven stores.
- **Operational Importance:** Instruments support community arts programs and touring musicians, enabling repeat customers in Brooklyn, Bronx, and Long Island markets while feeding retail showcases with unique inventory.
- **Multi-Store Handling:** Evaluation rooms include tuning gear, amps, keyboard stands, and cleaning kits; XPawn templates capture make, model, serial, finish, case type, and accessory lists.

## Valuation Process (Very Detailed)
1. **Brand & Model Impact:** Recognize value tiers (Fender/Gibson/PRS higher; entry-level brands lower). Yamaha and Roland keyboards maintain strong demand; vintage brands require extra authentication.
2. **Structural Inspection:** Check neck relief, fret wear, cracks, binding separation, lifted bridges, or loose valves; document in XPawn photos.
3. **Playability Testing:** Plug in electric instruments, test pickups, run through amps; acoustic instruments played for resonance; keyboards tested for key response and display functionality.
4. **Finish & Cosmetic Review:** Evaluate scratches, buckle rash, lacquer checking, tarnished hardware; notable wear may appeal to collectors but usually reduces resale.
5. **Accessory Assessment:** Hard case vs soft case (hard cases add value, protect during storage), straps, pedals, mouthpieces, reeds, cables.
6. **Market Demand:** Monitor local school programs, church groups, and touring seasons; adjust valuation for instruments in high demand (e.g., saxophones during school enrollment).
7. **Risk Assessment:** Serial numbers checked, especially for high-value instruments; watch for counterfeit labels or swapped headstocks.
8. **Loan-to-Value Rules:** LTV generally ranges from 40–65% of resale value depending on brand, condition, and accessory completeness.
9. **Customer Misconceptions:** Owners may assume sentimental value equates to cash value or that vintage status automatically yields premium; staff clarifies based on market proof.

## Pawn Loan Workflow for Musical Instruments
1. **Intake & ID:** Customer profile updated; instrument photographed with serial close-ups.
2. **Testing:** Tune/play instrument, check electronics, inspect valves/pads, verify keyboard functions, document any issues.
3. **Valuation:** Combine brand recognition, condition, accessory presence, and demand to calculate principal using set LTV range.
4. **Ticket Issuance:** XPawn ticket includes make/model, serial, finish, case type, accessories, and condition notes.
5. **Storage:** Instruments stored in climate-controlled areas; guitars hung or placed in racks; brass stored with drying agents; keyboards covered and tagged.
6. **Typical LTV Percentages:** 40–65% of resale value; premium brands with hard cases trend higher.
7. **Loan Amount Ranges:** Entry-level for student instruments; mid-tier for name-brand guitars/keyboards; higher tiers for vintage or pro-grade gear.

## Buying Workflow
- **Evaluation:** Same as pawn workflow; staff may offer higher payouts for in-demand models or limited editions.
- **Resale Potential:** Instruments destined for retail floor displays, online listings, or collector networks; vintage pieces may receive extra marketing.
- **Marketplace Considerations:** Review recent sales on Reverb, eBay, and regional music stores; consider refurb costs (new strings, pad replacements).
- **Purchase vs Pawn Decision:** Recommend purchase when instrument needs major repairs, when owner is liquidating estate collections, or when resale demand exceeds loan appetite.

## Common Issues & Risk Conditions
- **Stolen Goods Indicators:** Scratched serial plates, removed inventory tags from schools, or conflicting ownership stories; reported per LeadsOnline requirements.
- **Counterfeit Detection:** Fake Gibson/Fender decals, incorrect headstock shapes, or mismatched hardware; staff declines suspicious instruments.
- **Broken/Inoperable Instruments:** Cracked necks, warped soundboards, stuck valves, or dead electronics reduce value; may still qualify for lower offers if repairable.
- **Missing Accessories:** Lack of hard case, power adapter, or mouthpiece lowers payout; staff encourages customers to provide accessories to improve offers.
- **Customer Disputes:** Demonstrate tuning/playability issues, highlight repair estimates, and show market comps to explain valuation.
