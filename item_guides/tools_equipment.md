# King Gold & Pawn Item Guide – Tools & Equipment

## Category Overview
- **Scope:** Power tools, hand tools, compressors, lawn equipment, contractor gear, surveying instruments, and specialty shop equipment from brands such as Milwaukee, DeWalt, Makita, Bosch, and Hilti, accepted at all seven stores.
- **Operational Importance:** Tools deliver steady pawn volume in Brooklyn, Bronx, and Freeport locations serving tradespeople; durable collateral provides dependable resale and strong community relationships.
- **Multi-Store Handling:** Each store maintains testing outlets, battery chargers, accessory bins, and XPawn templates capturing model numbers, serials, and accessory lists; large equipment stored in secure cages or backroom racks.

## Valuation Process (Very Detailed)
1. **Brand & Model Verification:** Staff records exact model numbers (e.g., Milwaukee 2804-20) and serials; authenticity confirmed via manufacturer databases when needed.
2. **Condition Assessment:** Inspect housing for cracks, missing guards, rust, or heavy wear; evaluate battery health (charge retention) for cordless tools.
3. **Functional Testing:** Plug in or power up; test RPM, torque, blade alignment, laser guides, or measurement accuracy; note abnormal sounds or overheating.
4. **Accessory Check:** Verify chargers, batteries, blades, bits, cases, depth guides, and wrenches; missing accessories reduce value.
5. **Battery vs Corded Tools:** Cordless tools require at least one functioning OEM battery/charger; corded tools must have intact cords and grounded plugs.
6. **Market Demand:** Reference seasonal demand (construction peaks, lawn season) and local requests; high-demand brand kits receive higher LTV.
7. **Risk Assessment:** Watch for altered serial plates, mismatched cases, or graffiti markings; suspicious items escalate to manager review.
8. **Loan-to-Value Rules:** LTV typically ranges from 35–65% of current resale value; high-end tool kits with full accessories trend higher.
9. **Customer Misconceptions:** Some believe customized markings lower value to zero; staff explains documentation helps prove ownership but may still impact desirability.

## Pawn Loan Workflow for Tools & Equipment
1. **Intake & ID:** Customer profile verified; tool photographed; serial number entered into XPawn.
2. **Testing Procedures:** Power cycle the tool, run under load briefly, confirm battery charge, evaluate safety mechanisms.
3. **Valuation:** Factor brand, condition, accessory completeness, and market demand; apply LTV percentage.
4. **Ticket Issuance:** XPawn ticket lists brand, model, serial, accessory list, and any markings; customer signs acknowledgement.
5. **Storage:** Tools cleaned, bagged, and stored on labeled racks; batteries stored at safe charge with separators; high-value kits placed in locked cages.
6. **Typical LTV Percentages:** 35–65% of resale; full kits with multiple batteries may reach top end.
7. **Loan Amount Ranges:** Entry-level amounts for single drills; mid-tier for combo kits or saws; higher tiers for compressors, generators, or specialty gear.

## Buying Workflow
- **Evaluation:** Same as pawn workflow; staff may offer premium for complete kits with minimal wear.
- **Resale Potential:** Tools with high demand stocked in-store; duplicates or off-season items sold via wholesale or online marketplaces.
- **Marketplace Considerations:** Evaluate eBay sold listings, contractor demand, and local pricing; reconditioned tools priced competitively.
- **Purchase vs Pawn Decision:** Recommend purchase when tools are obsolete, heavily worn, or when customer wants immediate sale without redemption intent.

## Common Issues & Risk Conditions
- **Stolen Goods Indicators:** Ground-off serials, mismatched cases, or inconsistent project stories; staff documents and may contact authorities per policy.
- **Counterfeit Detection:** Off-brand housings with premium logos, incorrect paint, or non-OEM batteries; staff declines questionable items.
- **Broken/Inoperable Tools:** Cracked housings, missing safety guards, or dead motors reduce value or result in rejection; documented thoroughly.
- **Missing Accessories:** Lack of chargers/batteries may reduce value significantly; staff requests accessories to improve offer.
- **Customer Disputes:** Demonstrate function tests and accessory needs; explain how resale buyers expect complete kits.

## NYC / Long Island / Westchester Considerations
- **State Laws:** Article 5 governs documentation; tickets must include brand, model, and serial information.
- **Police Reporting:** Serial numbers submitted through LeadsOnline; aids law enforcement when tools are tied to jobsite thefts.
- **Holding Periods:** Tools cannot be sold until 10-day notice expires for pawn loans; purchased items observe statutory waiting periods.
- **High-Value Handling:** Commercial equipment (compressors, generators) stored in secure cages with additional insurance logging.
