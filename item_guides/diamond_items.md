# King Gold & Pawn Item Guide – Diamond Items

## Category Overview
- **Scope:** Loose diamonds, engagement rings, tennis bracelets, stud earrings, pendants, certified stones, estate heirlooms, and designer diamond jewelry accepted at all seven stores.
- **Operational Importance:** Diamonds represent high-value, authentication-intensive collateral requiring consistent grading standards to maintain trust and accurate XPawn documentation.
- **Multi-Store Handling:** Each store maintains GIA reference sets, diamond microscopes, UV lamps, and Moissanite testers; grading data and photos are captured in XPawn attachments to ensure uniform decisions.

## Valuation Process (Very Detailed)
1. **Four Cs Framework:**
   - **Cut:** Evaluate brilliance, symmetry, and proportions using loupe/microscope; excellent cuts command higher LTVs.
   - **Color:** Compare against GIA master stones (D–Z scale); lower alphabetical grades reduce resale value.
   - **Clarity:** Identify inclusions and blemishes (IF to I3) under 10x magnification and log them in XPawn.
   - **Carat Weight:** Measure on digital scale; verify against certificates if available.
2. **Certification Status:** GIA, AGS, or IGI certificates increase transparency; non-certified stones require more conservative LTVs.
3. **Moissanite vs Diamond Testing:** Thermal/electrical conductivity testers confirm natural diamonds; suspicious stones undergo dual testing.
4. **Mounting Evaluation:** Inspect prongs, metal type, and craftsmanship; heavy damage may necessitate stone removal before vaulting.
5. **Pre-Owned Diamond Market Factors:** Fancy shapes, halo designs, or dated settings may influence resale velocity; staff references current wholesale price sheets.
6. **Risk Assessment:** Watch for fracture filling, laser drilling, clarity enhancements, or mismatched stones in multi-diamond pieces.
7. **Loan-to-Value Rules:** Typical LTV ranges from 45–70% of wholesale value depending on certification, size, and desirability.
8. **Customer Misconceptions:** Many assume retail appraisal equals loan value, or that certificates guarantee full payout; staff clarifies wholesale vs retail and explains enhancement impacts.

## Pawn Loan Workflow for Diamond Items
1. **Intake & ID:** Customer profile verified, items photographed, certificates scanned.
2. **Testing:** Conduct Moissanite/diamond tests, then evaluate Four Cs using loupe, microscope, and master stones.
3. **Valuation:** Reference wholesale price guides and XPawn historical data; apply LTV ratio based on size, certification, and condition.
4. **Ticket Creation:** XPawn ticket includes stone specs (carat, cut, color, clarity), mounting details, and certificate numbers.
5. **Storage:** Stones stored in tamper-evident gem jars within RFID vault trays; mounted pieces placed in padded boxes with desiccant packs.
6. **Typical LTV Percentages:** 45–70% of wholesale value; large certified stones may trend higher.
7. **Loan Amount Ranges:** Ranges vary widely—from modest amounts for small stones to high-tier brackets for multi-carat certified diamonds.

## Buying Workflow
- **Process:** Similar to pawn valuation but with the goal of outright purchase; staff may target higher margins if retail demand exists.
- **Resale Potential:** Premium pieces routed to store showcases, e-commerce listings, or dealer networks; lower-grade stones destined for wholesale.
- **Marketplace Considerations:** Condition of mounting, brand recognition (Tiffany, Cartier), and trend alignment (oval cuts, halo settings) influence resale decisions.
- **Purchase vs Pawn Guidance:** Recommend purchase when customers wish to liquidate permanently, when piece requires costly repairs, or when unbranded stones lag in resale demand.

## Common Issues & Risk Conditions
- **Stolen Goods Indicators:** Removed inscription numbers, inconsistent stories, or refusal to share purchase documentation; staff logs details for LeadsOnline.
- **Counterfeit Detection:** Moissanite, CZ, or lab-grown substitutes misrepresented as natural; testers and certification cross-checks identify them.
- **Broken/Insecure Settings:** Loose prongs or cracked shanks documented with photos; may reduce LTV.
- **Missing Accessories:** Lack of certificates or branded boxes noted; not mandatory but impacts retail premium.
- **Customer Disputes:** Staff explains wholesale-based valuations and demonstrates grading observations to maintain transparency.

## NYC / Long Island / Westchester Considerations

- **Police Reporting:** Stones logged with descriptions, certificate numbers, and inscriptions in LeadsOnline within statutory window.
- **Holding Periods:** Pawned diamonds cannot be sold until 10-day final notice expires; purchased diamonds observe mandatory waiting period before resale.
