# King Gold & Pawn Item Guide – Luxury Watches

## Category Overview
- **Scope:** High-end mechanical and quartz watches including Rolex, Audemars Piguet, Patek Philippe, Omega, Cartier, Breitling, and comparable models accepted at every store.
- **Operational Importance:** Luxury watches carry high principal potential and strong resale demand but require rigorous authentication to protect the brand reputation and comply with Article 5.
- **Multi-Store Handling:** Each location maintains watchmaking tools, pressure testers, and serial/reference databases; XPawn records include macro photographs, movement notes, and paperwork scans.

## Valuation Process (Very Detailed)
1. **Model & Reference Identification:** Staff checks reference numbers between lugs, casebacks, or warranty cards; cross-referenced with manufacturer charts.
2. **Serial Verification:** Serial numbers compared to stolen property databases and brand-specific ranges to confirm production era.
3. **Authenticity Markers:** Examine dial printing, rehaut engravings, movement finishing, rotor markings, and crown logos; poor craftsmanship often indicates replicas.
4. **Bracelet Stretch & Condition:** Measure link stretch, clasp integrity, and overall wear; heavy stretch reduces resale value and LTV.
5. **Case & Crystal Assessment:** Look for deep scratches, polishing loss, bezel wear, or aftermarket modifications; water-damage detection is critical.
6. **Movement Testing:** Timekeeping accuracy checked via timing machine; automatic winding efficiency evaluated; chronograph functions tested where applicable.
7. **Box & Papers Impact:** Original warranty cards, booklets, and boxes can add 5–15% to resale value depending on model.
8. **Battery/Water Resistance:** Quartz watches require battery tests; divers undergo pressure testing when tools available, otherwise disclaimers noted.
9. **Loan-to-Value Rules:** LTV typically ranges from 50–75% of current market value depending on model rarity and condition.
10. **Common Misconceptions:** Customers often think vintage polishing increases value or that aftermarket diamonds add price; staff explains how modifications hurt authenticity and resale.

## Pawn Loan Workflow for Luxury Watches
1. **Intake & ID:** Customer proven via ID; XPawn profile loaded; watch photographed alongside serial close-ups.
2. **Testing:** Serial/reference verification, movement functional checks, magnification inspection, magnetism testing if needed.
3. **Valuation:** Use current secondary market comps (Chrono24 trends, dealer sheets) adjusted for condition, box/papers, and demand.
4. **Ticket Issuance:** XPawn ticket includes brand, model, reference, serial, metal, bracelet type, and accessory list.
5. **Storage:** Watches placed in tamper-evident cases within padded watch trays; bracelets secured to prevent stretch.
6. **Typical LTV:** 50–75% of market value; iconic models (Submariner, Datejust, Royal Oak) skew higher due to liquidity.
7. **Loan Amount Ranges:** From mid-tier amounts for steel luxury watches to high-tier principals for gold or complication pieces; determined by market value not fixed schedules.

## Buying Workflow
- **Inspection:** Same as pawn workflow but includes negotiation on outright purchase price.
- **Resale Potential:** Assess demand, service history, and marketing potential; pieces may go to showcases, online listings, or watch dealers.
- **Marketplace Considerations:** Evaluate eBay completed sales, wholesale dealer quotes, and local retail appetite; box/paper sets prioritized for direct retail.
- **Purchase vs Pawn Decision:** Recommend purchase if watch has heavy aftermarket modifications, missing components, or if customer needs final sale rather than loan.

## Common Issues & Risk Conditions
- **Stolen Goods Indicators:** Scratched-off serials, mismatched papers, or attempts to obscure provenance; staff logs details and follows reporting rules.
- **Counterfeit Detection:** Replica movements, incorrect fonts, misaligned cyclops magnification, or incorrect weight; watchmaker review required for borderline cases.
- **Broken/Incomplete Items:** Non-functioning chronographs, missing bracelet screws, dead batteries; documented in XPawn and may reduce LTV.
- **Missing Accessories:** Lack of box/papers noted; not required for loans but influences resale channel.
- **Customer Disputes:** Staff reviews authenticity findings and market comps to explain valuations; manager can join if disagreement persists.

## NYC / Long Island / Westchester Considerations
- **State Laws:** Article 5 governs loans; high-value watches require same ID, ticket, and notice standards as other collateral.
- **Police Reporting:** Serial numbers and distinctive marks reported via LeadsOnline; suspicious pieces flagged for follow-up.
- **Holding Periods:** Pawned watches cannot be sold until 10-day final notice lapses; purchased watches observe statutory holding before retail display.
- **High-Value Handling:** Watches above internal thresholds stored in separate safes, sometimes with additional insurance riders; dual signatures required.
