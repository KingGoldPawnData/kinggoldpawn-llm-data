# King Gold & Pawn Item Guide – Electronics

## Category Overview
- **Scope:** Laptops, desktops, tablets, smartphones, gaming consoles, smartwatches, cameras, drones, and pro audio gear accepted at every King Gold & Pawn store.
- **Operational Importance:** Electronics provide steady loan traffic, especially in Brooklyn and Bronx locations, but require rigorous testing, data sanitation, and accessory management to protect customer privacy and resale value.
- **Multi-Store Handling:** Each store maintains diagnostics benches with chargers, adapters, data-wipe software, and XPawn templates for recording serial numbers, IMEI/MEID data, and accessory lists.

## Valuation Process (Very Detailed)
1. **Model & Specs Verification:** Staff identifies exact model numbers, CPU/GPU configurations, storage capacity, RAM, and generation year for accurate valuation.
2. **Physical Condition:** Assess screens for cracks, chassis for dents, port wear, and water indicators; note missing screws or swelling batteries.
3. **Functional Tests:** Boot devices, run quick diagnostics, check battery health (cycles), ensure buttons/ports function, and verify Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.
4. **Lock Status:** Confirm iCloud/Google accounts removed and device reset; locked devices are declined or valued drastically lower.
5. **Firmware Updates:** Evaluate if system requires updates; for buying/resale, staff may apply patches to improve marketability.
6. **Accessories:** Chargers, cables, controllers, stylus pens, camera lenses, and cases documented; missing accessories reduce LTV.
7. **Marketplace Demand:** Reference resale comps (eBay, Swappa, wholesale buyers) and local retail appetite; older devices may have minimal loan value.
8. **Risk Assessment:** Stolen device indicators (Find My iPhone active, mismatched accounts), counterfeit accessories, or tampered serial tags trigger additional verification.
9. **Loan-to-Value Rules:** Typical LTV ranges from 35–65% of current resale value depending on model age, condition, and accessory completeness.
10. **Common Misconceptions:** Customers often overestimate value due to original purchase price or ignore depreciation from missing chargers and outdated specs.

## Pawn Loan Workflow for Electronics
1. **Intake & ID:** Customer verified; XPawn profile updated; device sanitized before testing to avoid data exposure.
2. **Testing Procedures:** Power on, hardware diagnostics, battery health check, accessory validation, IMEI/serial capture.
3. **Valuation:** Apply depreciation matrix based on model age and resale velocity; determine LTV percentage.
4. **Ticket Issuance:** XPawn ticket includes device model, specs, serial/IMEI, accessory list, and condition notes.
5. **Storage:** Devices stored in padded bins with desiccant; batteries set to safe charge levels; high-value items kept in locked cages.
6. **Typical LTV Percentages:** 35–65% of resale value; premium devices with complete accessories trend higher.
7. **Loan Amount Ranges:** Entry-level amounts for older phones/tablets; mid-tier for modern laptops/consoles; upper tiers for pro audio gear or flagship devices.

## Buying Workflow
- **Assessment:** Same diagnostics performed; staff ensures data wiped and factory reset completed before finalizing purchase.
- **Spot Pricing:** Based on current resale comps and seasonal demand (holiday console spikes, back-to-school laptop demand).
- **Resale Channels:** Items with strong demand move to retail showrooms or e-commerce; older inventory wholesaled to refurb partners.
- **Purchase vs Pawn Decision:** Recommend purchase when devices are outdated, missing key accessories, or when customers prefer permanent sale.

## Common Issues & Risk Conditions
- **Stolen Goods Indicators:** Active user accounts, anti-theft messages, or mismatched serial paperwork; staff logs details and may decline.
- **Counterfeit Detection:** Cloned phones, fake AirPods, or unbranded chargers handled cautiously; authenticity checks applied.
- **Broken/Incomplete Items:** Cracked screens or missing ports reduce value but may still qualify for scrap; document thoroughly.
- **Missing Accessories:** Lower LTV or refusal for items lacking proprietary chargers/controllers; staff notes requirement to bring back accessories for higher payout.
- **Customer Disputes:** Staff demonstrates diagnostics and resale comps to explain valuation; escalations routed to manager when needed.
