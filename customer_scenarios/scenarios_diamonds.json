    "agent_response": "Yes, certified stones appraise faster and usually qualify for higher LTV because the 4Cs are documented. Bring the GIA report so we can verify the number against the laser inscription and attach a copy to your XPawn ticket.",

    "agent_response": "Insurance appraisals reflect replacement cost, not liquidation value. Pawn loans are based on realistic resale prices minus risk and overhead, which is why LTV is typically 40–60%. We'll walk through the math so you see how we landed at $4,000.",
