    "customer_message": "I have a 14K chain but I'm not sure it's real. How do you test it?",
    "agent_response": "We start with a magnet check, then use acid testing and XRF to confirm karat purity. We'll also inspect solder joints for base metals. Testing happens while you watch so you understand how we determine value before quoting a loan or purchase.",

    "customer_message": "What's the difference between 14K and 18K when pawning?",
    "agent_response": "18K contains 75% pure gold while 14K contains 58.5%, so higher karat usually brings a higher payout per gram. We weigh each piece on a calibrated scale, apply the day's market rate, and explain the calculations so you know how we arrived at the number.",

    "roleplay_type": "gold",
    "customer_message": "My hollow chain always gets lower offers. Why?",
    "agent_response": "Hollow chains contain less gold by weight and can dent easily, so they're valued closer to melt weight. We document the style and explain that resale demand is lower, which leads to a smaller loan or purchase price compared to a solid piece of the same length.",

    "customer_message": "Why is the melt price different from resale price in your showcases?",
    "agent_response": "Melt price reflects raw gold value minus refining costs. Retail jewelry includes craftsmanship, branding, and resale warranties, so pricing is higher. When we loan or buy from you, we base it on melt value plus any premium for designer or gemstone components.",

    "customer_message": "Do you take gold-filled or plated jewelry?",
    "agent_response": "We typically decline gold-plated items because the gold content is minimal. Gold-filled may be accepted if the base metal weight justifies it, but offers are much lower than solid gold. We'll test and let you know before proceeding.",
