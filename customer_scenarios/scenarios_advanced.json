    "agent_response": "I understand the frustration. Your $800 ticket from Bronx accrues interest monthly based on the Article 5 rate table you signed. Right now you're 60 days in, so the total due is $800 principal plus two months of interest, listed line-by-line on your ticket. If you need more time, you can pay only the interest to renew for another 120-day cycle.",

    "agent_response": "You're still within the mandatory 10-day notice window. We mailed and texted a notice via Twilio PawnOps, so if you come in before that certified notice expires, you can redeem by paying principal plus interest. After day 130, Article 5 lets us forfeit the collateral, so please visit Pitkin Ave as soon as possible.",

    "agent_response": "Call us before the term lapses and authorize an interest-only renewal.
