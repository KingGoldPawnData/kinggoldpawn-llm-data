    "agent_response": "Welcome in! Bring your item and a valid government-issued photo ID. We evaluate it on the spot, explain the offer, and if you agree we enter the ticket into XPawn. New York Article 5 sets a 120-day term plus a mandatory 10-day notice before anything is forfeited. You can repay early anytime at any of our stores and only owe principal plus accrued interest.",

    "agent_response": "Absolutely. After testing your chain we can quote both a loan value and an outright purchase price so you can decide. Selling is a one-time transaction, while pawning keeps ownership with you for the 120-day loan term. Let us know which option you prefer and we'll document it in XPawn.",

    "agent_response": "Yes, we make offers on broken gold because we value the actual metal weight after verifying karat. We'll weigh it on a calibrated scale, test it with acid and XRF if needed, and base the loan or purchase on melt value minus fees. Documenting condition protects you and us during storage.",
