# Buying & Selling Procedures
## Outright Purchase Process
- Verify identification identical to pawn loan requirements.
- Evaluate item using same appraisal standards; document ownership attestation form.
- Provide itemized purchase receipt with cash, ACH, or business check disbursement.

## Retail Sales Operations
- Display redeemed inventory after mandatory hold and police file clearance.
- Provide warranties where applicable (e.g., 7-day functionality guarantee for electronics) and offer layaway tracked within XPawn POS mode.
- Record sales tax according to jurisdiction (NYC vs Nassau vs Westchester) with daily batch exports into accounting system.

## Cross-Store Transfers
- Inventory analysts may relocate high-demand categories (e.g., gaming consoles to Pitkin Ave during holiday season). Transfers documented via XPawn transfer tickets, scanning item barcodes at origin and destination with chain-of-custody signatures.
