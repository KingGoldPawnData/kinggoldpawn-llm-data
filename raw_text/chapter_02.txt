# Store Setup & Security
## Site Selection Criteria
- **High-Footfall Corridors:** Proximity to subway nodes (Brighton Beach Ave, 5th Ave Sunset Park), bus transfer hubs (Pitkin Ave), and retail promenades (Southern Blvd Bronx) ensures constant prospect flow.
- **Zoning Compliance:** Each lease or ownership package is vetted for permitted retail use under NYC zoning, plus Article 5 pawnbroker licensing.
