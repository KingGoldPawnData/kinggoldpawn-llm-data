    "question": "How does King Gold & Pawn grade a diamond engagement ring?",
    "answer": "Appraisers follow the GIA Four Cs. They measure carat weight on a calibrated scale, inspect cut quality using microscopes, compare color against master stones, and note clarity characteristics such as inclusions or blemishes. All findings are entered into XPawn, along with photos and any certificate numbers, before quoting a loan or purchase value.",

    "question": "Do I need a GIA certificate to pawn my diamond?",
    "answer": "Certificates help, but they’re not required. If a stone lacks documentation, King Gold & Pawn performs in-house grading using microscopes, master stones, and measurement tools. Certified stones may receive higher LTVs because the grading is independently verified, but uncertified stones are still eligible for loans.",

    "id": "diamond-003",
    "question": "How do you test whether a stone is diamond or moissanite?",
    "answer": "Staff uses both thermal and electrical conductivity testers because moissanite can mimic diamond on a single device. If results are inconclusive, they inspect the stone under magnification for double refraction or facet junction behavior. These steps ensure that only genuine diamonds are recorded as such in XPawn.",

  {
    "id": "diamond-004",
    "question": "What factors reduce the loan amount on a diamond?",
    "answer": "Low color grades, visible inclusions, poor cut proportions, chips, loose prongs, and dated settings can lower demand. King Gold & Pawn explains how each factor affects resale value, and XPawn stores these notes so the same reasoning is visible during renewals or audits.",

  {
    "id": "diamond-005",
    "question": "Can I pawn loose diamonds separately from the setting?",
    "answer": "Yes. Customers can request that stones be evaluated and loaned separately. In that case, stones are weighed, graded, and stored in sealed gem jars with tamper tags, while the setting can be evaluated as gold. XPawn creates linked entries so redemption includes both components.",

  {
    "id": "diamond-006",
    "question": "Do you buy lab-grown diamonds?",
    "answer": "King Gold & Pawn primarily deals in natural diamonds because they retain resale value better in New York markets. If a stone is lab-grown, staff discloses how the secondary market differs and may decline it or offer a reduced LTV. Transparency is critical so customers understand the price difference.",

    "question": "How do you handle diamonds with laser inscriptions?",
    "answer": "Laser inscriptions are recorded in XPawn along with certificate references. Staff confirms the inscription under magnification, photographs it, and stores the data with the ticket so the stone can be matched precisely at redemption.",

  {
    "id": "diamond-008",
    "question": "Do fancy shapes like oval or pear impact value?",
    "answer": "Yes. Fancy shapes follow the same 4C principles, but market demand fluctuates. Currently, ovals and pears are popular, so LTVs may be comparable to round stones if cut well. King Gold & Pawn references wholesale sheets and retail trends to ensure the offer reflects current demand.",

    "id": "diamond-009",
    "question": "Can I bring multiple diamond items for one valuation?",
    "answer": "Absolutely. Staff grades each piece separately, whether it’s stud earrings, tennis bracelets, or engagement rings. XPawn can group them under one ticket with detailed line items so you know the loan amount assigned to each piece.",

    "id": "diamond-010",
    "question": "What is the difference between pawn and outright sale for diamonds?",
    "answer": "Pawn loans keep ownership with you for 120 days, letting you redeem the diamond later. Outright sales transfer ownership immediately in exchange for a final payout. King Gold & Pawn walks you through both scenarios, explaining offer differences and the impact on future resale or heirloom plans.",

  {
    "id": "diamond-011",
    "question": "Do you evaluate diamond earrings as a pair or individually?",
    "answer": "Pairs are evaluated together but each stone is measured for carat, color, and clarity to confirm they match. If one stone grades lower, the valuation reflects the weaker stone because resale buyers expect matched pairs. XPawn notes the individual grades for future reference.",

  {
    "id": "diamond-012",
    "question": "How do you detect clarity enhancements like fracture filling?",
    "answer": "Under magnification, appraisers look for flash effects, unusual color flashes, or filler bubbles. Suspicious stones may be referred to senior gemologists. Enhanced stones receive lower LTVs because repairs can fail over time, and XPawn records the finding to ensure transparency with customers.",

    "id": "diamond-013",
    "question": "Do you take antique or vintage diamond jewelry?",
    "answer": "Yes. Vintage rings, Art Deco pieces, and estate jewelry are welcome. Staff assesses the diamonds plus the craftsmanship of the setting, explaining whether the offer is based on gem value, metal value, or collectible appeal. Lawrence and Brighton Beach frequently handle estate collections with full documentation.",

    "question": "How does market demand affect my diamond loan offer?",
    "answer": "Diamond prices fluctuate with global demand. King Gold & Pawn reviews current Rapaport-style pricing, local retail interest, and e-commerce trends. If certain cuts or sizes are moving quickly, LTVs may be higher; if demand slows, offers adjust accordingly. Transparency is key, so staff explains the market conditions during the appraisal.",

    "answer": "Yes. The New Rochelle location at 217 North Ave (914-809-8980) offers express intake for commuters. Call ahead or walk in, and staff will prioritize diamond grading so you can catch your train after receiving a loan or purchase offer.",

    "question": "Do you store my diamond securely while it’s pawned?",
    "answer": "Diamonds are placed in sealed gem jars with RFID labels, stored in UL-rated vault drawers under dual control. XPawn tracks the exact bin location, and tamper-evident seals are inspected at redemption to confirm the stone’s integrity.",

  {
    "id": "diamond-017",
    "question": "Will cleaning my ring before visiting improve the offer?",
    "answer": "A clean ring makes grading easier because dirt can mask inclusions or color tint. While cleaning doesn’t change the intrinsic 4Cs, it helps appraisers evaluate the stone quickly, which is helpful when stores like Brighton Beach handle high volumes of diamond jewelry.",

  {
    "id": "diamond-018",
    "question": "Do you accept diamond tennis bracelets with missing stones?",
    "answer": "Yes, but missing stones reduce value. Staff grades the remaining stones, weighs the gold, and estimates repair cost. Offers may be based on total diamond weight minus replacement expenses. Customers can still pawn or sell the piece, but the valuation reflects the work required to restore it.",

  {
    "id": "diamond-019",
    "question": "Why do you photograph my diamonds during intake?",
    "answer": "Photos document the stone’s appearance, setting, and any distinguishing marks. XPawn stores these images so everyone knows exactly what was pledged, helping with identification during audit checks, renewal discussions, or redemption.",

    "question": "Can I request a copy of your grading notes?",
    "answer": "Yes. Staff can print or email the XPawn appraisal notes summarizing the 4Cs, testing results, and valuation assumptions. While it’s not a formal certificate, it provides transparency and helps customers compare offers or plan future visits.",

  {
    "id": "diamond-021",
    "question": "How do you handle designer rings like Tiffany or Cartier?",
    "answer": "Designer rings are authenticated via stamps, serials, and paperwork. When legitimate, they may receive premiums above raw diamond and gold value because the brand adds resale demand. The Lawrence office often handles these pieces with private appointments for estate clients.",

  {
    "id": "diamond-022",
    "question": "Do you accept colored diamonds?",
    "answer": "Yes. Fancy colored diamonds are evaluated for hue, saturation, and tone in addition to the standard 4Cs. Because the market can be niche, staff may consult specialized price guides before finalizing the quote. Transparency about market demand is part of the discussion.",

    "id": "diamond-023",
    "question": "What if I disagree with the grade you assign?",
    "answer": "Staff will re-examine the stone, explain the grading criteria, and show you the inclusions or color comparisons driving the grade. You’re free to decline the offer if you prefer another opinion. Transparency and education are core to the King Gold & Pawn process.",

  {
    "id": "diamond-024",
    "question": "Can I pawn a diamond pendant and still wear the chain?",
    "answer": "If you want to keep the chain, staff can remove the pendant during intake, grade the diamond, and loan against it separately. The chain can either be pawned under a gold ticket or returned immediately. XPawn records which components are held so redemption is straightforward.",

  {
    "id": "diamond-025",
    "question": "Do you share diamond data with other stores?",
    "answer": "Yes. Because XPawn syncs every 15 minutes, managers in any location can review prior grading notes, certificates, or images if you visit a different store. This continuity ensures your past history is respected and speeds up renewals or additional loans.",
