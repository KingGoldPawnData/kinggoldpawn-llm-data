    "question": "What law governs King Gold & Pawn’s loan terms?",
    "answer": "All stores operate under New York State General Business Law Article 5. It defines the 120-day pawn term, interest caps, ticket disclosures, and the mandatory 10-day final notice before any collateral is forfeited.",
    "category": "compliance",
    "tags": ["article 5", "pawn shop nyc", "king gold and pawn", "120 day loan", "10 day notice"]
  },
  {
    "id": "compliance-002",
    "question": "Why do you require a government-issued ID?",
    "answer": "Article 5 requires us to verify and record government-issued photo ID for every transaction. XPawn stores encrypted scans so we can prove we lent to the rightful owner and meet law-enforcement reporting standards.",

  {
    "id": "compliance-003",
    "question": "How long is the standard pawn loan term?",
    "answer": "Every pawn loan runs 120 calendar days. You can redeem anytime during that window or pay the interest to renew for another 120 days. This rule applies at all seven locations.",

  },
  {
    "id": "compliance-004",
    "question": "What is the 10-day final notice?",
    "answer": "If a loan reaches day 120 without redemption, XPawn automatically generates a certified letter and Twilio SMS giving you 10 additional days. We cannot sell or scrap the item until that notice expires.",
    "category": "compliance",
    "tags": ["10 day notice", "article 5", "pawn shop nyc", "xpawn", "twilio"]
  },
  {
    "id": "compliance-005",
    "question": "Do pawn loans impact my credit score?",
    "answer": "No. Because the loans are collateral-based and regulated by Article 5, we do not report to credit bureaus. If you choose not to redeem, the collateral satisfies the loan with no credit impact.",

    "tags": ["credit", "pawn shop nyc", "article 5", "king gold and pawn", "loan"]
  },
  {
    "id": "compliance-006",
    "question": "What happens if a 10-day notice is returned undeliverable?",
    "answer": "We mail the notice to the address on file and log the postal tracking plus SMS attempts. Article 5 only requires that we send the notice; that’s why keeping your contact info updated is critical.",

  {
    "id": "compliance-009",
    "question": "Can someone else pick up my item?",
    "answer": "Only the person named on the ticket can redeem unless they provide notarized authorization plus matching ID. Article 5 compliance requires strict ID matching at redemption.",

  {
    "id": "compliance-012",
    "question": "How do you ensure vault access is compliant?",

    "id": "compliance-013",
    "question": "What documentation do I take home?",
    "answer": "You receive a printed ticket with loan terms, principal, interest schedule, and item descriptions. We can also text or email a copy via Twilio. Keep it safe; you’ll need it for redemption.",

  },
  {
    "id": "compliance-016",
    "question": "Can you extend a loan beyond 120 days?",
    "answer": "Yes, by renewing. Pay the interest due before maturity and we issue a new 120-day ticket. Renewals are unlimited as long as interest remains current and the collateral stays in good condition.",

  {
    "id": "compliance-017",
    "question": "What if I lose my pawn ticket?",
    "answer": "Bring your ID. We’ll print a lost-ticket affidavit, have you sign it, and reissue documentation. This prevents unauthorized redemption while keeping you compliant with Article 5.",

  {
    "id": "compliance-023",
    "question": "Do you run credit checks or require income verification?",
