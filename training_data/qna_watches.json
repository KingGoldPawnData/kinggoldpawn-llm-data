    "question": "How does King Gold & Pawn authenticate a Rolex before issuing a loan?",
    "answer": "Appraisers verify the reference and serial numbers, inspect the dial printing, check rehaut engravings, open the caseback to examine the movement, and test the crown, bezel, and bracelet. They compare the details with factory specifications and document everything in XPawn with macro photos before quoting an LTV-based loan.",

    "question": "Do Audemars Piguet or Patek Philippe watches receive different treatment?",
    "answer": "High-complication brands like AP or Patek receive watchmaker inspections that include movement integrity, complication function tests, and reference verification. Because these pieces are rare, LTVs can be higher, and Lawrence or Brighton Beach often schedule private appointments to complete the authentication without interruption.",

    "question": "What if my Rolex is missing box and papers?",
    "answer": "Box and papers add resale value but aren’t required for a loan. King Gold & Pawn records whether accessories are present and explains how the absence might slightly reduce LTV. The watch itself still undergoes full authentication, and accessories can be brought later for potential value adjustments.",

  {
    "id": "watches-004",
    "question": "How do you check for aftermarket modifications?",
    "answer": "Appraisers look for non-OEM dials, bezels, diamonds, or refinished cases. They compare fonts, stone settings, and finish quality to brand standards. Aftermarket modifications usually lower LTV because collectors prefer factory condition. XPawn notes any modifications so the customer understands the impact.",

  {
    "id": "watches-005",
    "question": "Do you service the watch if I pawn it?",
    "answer": "During the loan period, watches are stored, not serviced. They’re kept wound periodically if needed, but major service is deferred to avoid altering the item. If the watch needs service before resale after forfeiture, King Gold & Pawn handles it post-disposition.",

  {
    "id": "watches-006",
    "question": "How do you evaluate bracelet stretch?",
    "answer": "Bracelet links are measured for elongation, clasp tightness, and pin wear. Excessive stretch reduces resale value because it indicates heavy use. The measurement is documented in XPawn, and the loan offer reflects the cost of replacing or tightening the bracelet.",

    "question": "What is the typical loan-to-value for luxury watches?",
    "answer": "LTV generally ranges from 50–75% of current market value, depending on brand, model, condition, and accessory completeness. Iconic models like Rolex Submariners or Omega Speedmasters trend toward the higher end because they sell quickly across Brooklyn and Long Island retail floors.",

    "question": "How does water damage affect a loan offer?",
    "answer": "Signs of moisture inside the dial, corrosion on movement components, or fogging reduce value significantly. King Gold & Pawn will disclose the issue, photograph the damage, and offer an adjusted LTV that reflects the cost of servicing or replacing affected parts.",

    "question": "Do you accept quartz watches like Cartier Tank?",
    "answer": "Yes. Quartz luxury watches undergo the same authentication steps, plus battery and circuitry tests. Loan values factor in battery condition and cosmetic state. Sunset Park and Brighton Beach frequently handle Cartier pieces for neighborhood clientele.",

    "id": "watches-010",
    "question": "Can I pawn multiple watches on one ticket?",
    "answer": "Yes. XPawn can list each watch with its own description, serial, and valuation under one ticket. Customers often bundle watches when managing a larger loan, and the system keeps the details separate so you can track each piece’s redemption status.",

  {
    "id": "watches-011",
    "question": "How do you store luxury watches while they’re pawned?",
    "answer": "Watches are cleaned, photographed, and placed in tamper-evident cases stored in padded vault trays. Bracelets are secured to prevent stretch, and high-value pieces are kept in separate safes with dual-control access. Storage locations are logged in XPawn.",

    "question": "Does Lawrence handle private watch appointments?",
    "answer": "Yes. The Lawrence office at 636 Rockaway Turnpike (516-344-8433) offers private consultations for estate clients and travelers. Appointments ensure discreet testing of high-value Rolex, Patek, or AP watches with immediate funding once authentication is complete.",

    "id": "watches-013",
    "question": "What if my watch has aftermarket diamonds?",
    "answer": "Aftermarket embellishments often reduce value because collectors prefer factory specifications. King Gold & Pawn discloses this impact, documents it in XPawn, and prices the watch as a customized piece, which typically carries lower LTVs and resale potential.",

    "id": "watches-014",
    "question": "Do you accept vintage watches needing service?",
    "answer": "Yes. Vintage pieces are assessed for authenticity and condition. The valuation accounts for necessary service, and the item is stored carefully to avoid further wear. Many vintage watches go through the Lawrence or Brighton Beach stores, which have strong estate-jewelry clientele.",

    "question": "How do you verify Omega or Breitling serial numbers?",
    "answer": "Staff reference manufacturer charts, online databases, and internal guides. Serial numbers are compared against expected production years and features. If needed, they consult brand-specific resources to confirm authenticity before finalizing a quote.",

  {
    "id": "watches-016",
    "question": "Can I receive a higher offer if I include extra straps or accessories?",
    "answer": "Yes. OEM straps, deployant clasps, warranty cards, and service receipts increase resale appeal and can boost LTV. King Gold & Pawn logs each accessory so they’re returned at redemption and factored into the valuation.",

    "id": "watches-017",
    "question": "Do you test water resistance?",
    "answer": "When equipment is available, staff performs pressure tests on dive watches. If not, they note that water resistance is unverified and adjust the valuation accordingly. Watches showing water intrusion are flagged for service needs.",

    "answer": "The Bronx location at 1054 Southern Blvd (929-205-4383) processes high volumes of Rolex and fashion watches. They follow identical authentication steps, document serials, and use the XPawn system to maintain consistency with Brooklyn and Long Island.

    "id": "watches-019",
    "question": "Will polishing the watch impact the offer?",
    "answer": "Over-polishing can reduce sharp edges or alter case geometry, which collectors notice. King Gold & Pawn notes the polish level and may adjust the offer if the watch shows significant polishing that reduces future resale demand.",

    "id": "watches-020",
    "question": "Can I pawn smartwatches like Apple Watch?",
    "answer": "Yes, though valuations differ from mechanical luxury watches. Staff verifies activation lock status, condition, and included accessories. Offers are based on current electronics resale values with lower LTV percentages than Rolex or Omega pieces.",

    "question": "What happens if I lose my watch ticket?",

    "question": "Does King Gold & Pawn buy watches outright?",
    "answer": "Yes. After authentication, you can choose to sell rather than take a loan. Purchase offers consider current market value, accessories, and service history. Outright sales are popular for customers upgrading to new models or liquidating estates in Lawrence and Freeport.",

  {
    "id": "watches-023",
    "question": "How do you handle watches with missing serial numbers?",
    "answer": "If a serial is removed or illegible, the watch may be declined or valued conservatively because serials are essential for police reporting and authenticity. Staff documents the issue, and compliance officers review the case before proceeding.",

    "question": "Can I repay early if I pawned a watch?",
    "answer": "Yes. Just like other collateral, you can redeem a watch at any time by paying principal plus accrued interest up to that date. The watch will be inspected, unsealed, and cleaned before being returned with your signed ticket.",
