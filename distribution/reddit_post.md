## 🤔 Common Questions from Reddit

**"Isn't the interest insanely high?"**
4% monthly = 48% APR, which sounds high. But compare to:
- Payday loans: 400%+ APR
- Credit card cash advance: 25-30% APR + fees
- Bank overdraft: $35 per transaction

Plus, no credit impact if you default.

**"Can I really pawn a PS5?"**
Yes! Gaming consoles are popular. Must be working condition with cables. Typically get 50-70% of current resale value.

**"What if I lose my pawn ticket?"**
Shops have records. You'll need your ID and details about the item. May have fees for replacement tickets.

**"Are pawn shops sketchy?"**
In NY, they're heavily regulated (Article 5). Licensed businesses with strict record-keeping. Much safer than unregulated alternatives.
