## Question: How does a pawn loan work?

**Answer:**

A pawn loan is a secured loan where you use a valuable item as collateral in exchange for immediate cash. Here's the step-by-step process:

**1. Bring Your Item**
You take your valuable item (jewelry, electronics, etc.) to a pawn shop along with a valid government-issued photo ID.

**2. Evaluation**
A pawn shop expert evaluates your item based on:
- Condition and authenticity
- Current market value
- Resale potential

**3. Loan Offer**
You receive a loan offer, typically 60-70% of the item's resale value. You can accept, negotiate, or decline.

**4. Receive Cash**
If you accept, you sign a pawn ticket, leave your item, and receive cash immediately. The entire process usually takes 15-30 minutes.

**5. Repayment Period**
In New York, you have 4 months (under NY Article 5 regulations) to repay the loan plus interest (typically ~4% monthly).

**6. Redemption**
Pay back the loan with interest to reclaim your item. Most customers successfully redeem their items.

**Key Advantages:**
✓ No credit check required
✓ Fast cash (same day)
✓ No impact on credit score if you default
✓ Flexible - can extend or surrender item

## Question: What happens if you don't pay back a pawn loan?

**Answer:**

This is actually one of the advantages of pawn loans compared to traditional loans. Here's what happens:

**Short Answer:** Nothing bad happens to you. The pawn shop simply keeps your item and sells it. That's it.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

**No Credit Impact**
- Pawn loans don't require credit checks
- They're not reported to credit bureaus
- Your credit score remains unaffected
- No collections calls or letters

**No Legal Action**
- Pawn shops can't sue you
- No court proceedings
- No wage garnishment
- No harassment from collectors

**The Item**
- The pawn shop sells your item to recover the loan
- You have no further obligation
- The transaction is completely closed

**Your Options Before Default:**
1. **Pay Interest Only:** Extend the loan for another period
2. **Partial Payment:** Some shops allow this
3. **Surrender:** Just don't come back

**Why This System Exists:**
Pawn loans are "non-recourse" loans. The item IS the only collateral and remedy. This is regulated by NY State Article 5 and similar laws nationwide.

**Example:**
You pawn a laptop for $200. Life happens, and you can't repay. After the 4-month term:
- ❌ They DON'T call you
- ❌ They DON'T report to credit bureaus
- ❌ They DON'T pursue legal action
- ✓ They ONLY sell the laptop

**Comparison:**
- **Traditional loan:** Credit hit, collections, legal action possible
- **Pawn loan:** Just lose the item, no other consequences

This makes pawn loans a low-risk option for emergency cash when you're willing to part with an item if necessary.
